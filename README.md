This repository contains an GenAI project that helps a User to explore a new city and gives him historic information. A guide can be generated by filling in a form or by interacting with the Chatbot. Next steps :

1) Create a route through the city
2) Add an AR interface and a good UI
3) Provide detailed information about transportation,accessability, public places to rest etc.
4) Speed it up, currently the generation of a text for guiding takes several minutes.
